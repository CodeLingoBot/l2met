Turn these:
```ruby
$stdout.puts("measure#db.latency=4ms")
$stdout.puts("count#db.vaccum=1")
$stdout.puts("sample#db.size=100GB")
```

L2met receives HTTP requests that contain a body of RFC5424 formatted data. Commonly, data is drained into l2met by [logplex](https://github.com/heroku/logplex) or [log-shuttle](https://github.com/heroku/log-shuttle). Once data is delivered, l2met extracts and parses the log lines using the [logging conventions](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/l2met/wiki/Usage#log-conventions) and then stores the data in redis so that l2met outlets can read the data, build metrics, and deliver the metrics to your Librato account.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get l2met up and running is to deploy to Heroku. This guide assumes you have already created a Heroku & Librato account.

```bash
$ curl https://drone.io/github.com/ryandotsmith/l2met/files/l2met.tar.gz | tar xvz
$ ./scripts/setup my-l2met e@foo.com abc123
...
Drain URL: https://long-token@my-l2met.herokuapp.com/logs
```

This command will create Heroku app named *my-l2met* and return a drain URL with encrypted Librato credentials for a Librato account with email *e@foo.com* and an API token of *abc123*. After you have created *my-l2met*, you can add the drain URL to a Heroku app. A copy of the log stream will be delivered to *my-l2met* and metrics will be sent to the Librato account which your provided in the setup.

```bash
$ heroku drains:add https://long-token@my-l2met.herokuapp.com/logs -a myapp
```
